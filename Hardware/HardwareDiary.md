# Hardware Log

### Week Beginning 04/03/2019
* Looking into single board computers which would be suitable for the project.
	* Ideally smaller than a Raspberry Pi 3 B +, but more powerful than a RPi Zero.
	* RPi 3 A + was found as the only feaseable solution.
* Research into off the shelf cases which would suit above RPi 3 A + board, and required supporting hardware.

### Week Beginning 11/03/2019
* Rough design of possible case solutions, including extruded aluminium, COTS plastic enclosures, and custom cut acryllic.
	* Modeling of above designs in Fusion 360, including rough design of custom printed circuit assemblies to see mechanical fit.
* Preliminary schematic design for RPi 3A+ Hat to allow prelim BOM generation and costing.
* Preliminary schematic design for RPi Zero W Hat to allow prelim BOM generation and costing.
* BOM generation and component selection for both Hats.
* Estimated costing for both RPi Zero and RPi 3A+ devices, inclusive of PCA's and supporting hardware.

### Week Beginning 18/03/2019
* Created footprints and sourced / drew 3D models for all required components on PCA.
* Laid out RPiZero Hat, begun layout on RPi3A+ hat.
* Ordered parts from Mouser for new boards.
* Plans for RPi3A+ hat changed, no longer integrating charge circuit so changed schematic and laid out new design.
* Finished layout for both boards, got team approval, order placed 23/3/19 with JLCPCB. ETA Friday Week 5.

### Week Beginning 25/03/2019
* Extended discussions between Josh and Chris regarding possbile case designs going forward.
* Prelim case design for RPi3A+ completed. Awaiting boards for RPiZero before continuing with case design for the smaller platform. 
* General Makerspace + specific laser induction completed by Josh, will allow use of laser cutter to cut acrylic. 
* Shopping trip to purchase all required hardware for prototype build. 
* Test fitting and changes to mechanicals to account for differences in models vs actual.

### Week Beginning 1/04/2019
* Manufacturing of acrylic enclosure including updating lens mounting.
* Assembly of PCA's and testing, all appear to be functioning nominally. 

### Week Beginning 8/04/2019
* Laid out v2 of the VeinCam Zero to better fit a custom cut acrylic case instead of the official RPi case. 
* Begun design of v2 enclosure for the VeinCam Zero
* Changed VeinCam Plus enclosure to decrease size of IR acrylic required. 

### Week Beginning 15/04/2019
* Continued design of the v2 enclosure, and found it very hard to design around. 
* Through discussions with Ben and the team, have decided to scrap the zero due to the design challenges we will face wrt hardware, and the lack of performance which software is experiencing. 

### Week Beginning 22/04/2019
* Cut new case designs including IR acrylic for first time.
* Handed out to team members and Ben, awaiting feedback before continuing further.
