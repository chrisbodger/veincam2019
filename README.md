# VeinCam 2019

This is the repository for the continuation of the VeinCam Project for ANU ENGN4221. The repository for Last Semester can be found [HERE](https://www.github.com/chrisbodger/veincam). This repository is created to delineate the progress made this semester from the progress made from last semester, and present a clear direction for this next stage.

## Project Goals
There are 3 goals we wish to achieve this semester:

1. Develop a set of hardware requirements that are suitable for the VeinCam Project.
2. Optimise the software to run more efficiently.
3. Compile procurement options to develop kits to be able to be sold onto those who wish to build a VeinCam for themselves.
