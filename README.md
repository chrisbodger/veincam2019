# VeinCam 2019

This is the repository for the continuation of the VeinCam Project for ANU ENGN4221. The repository for Last Semester can be found [HERE](https://www.github.com/chrisbodger/veincam). This repository is created to delineate the progress made this semester from the progress made from last semester, and present a clear direction for this next stage.

## Project Goals
There are 3 goals we wish to achieve this semester:

1. Develop a set of hardware requirements that are suitable for the VeinCam Project.
2. Optimise the software to run more efficiently.
3. Compile procurement options to develop kits to be able to be sold onto those who wish to build a VeinCam for themselves.

## Project Updates
### Week 4 Audit - 18/03/2019
#### Hardware
The hardware team have spent their time over the last 2 weeks exploring options for alternative hardware. It was determined that the Raspberry Pi is still the preferable platform, given its flexibility as a micro-computer and development platform for small hobby projects. The RasPi Zero is still chosen as our primary device, however it could be worthwhile to have a device with more inherent processing power available. Enter the RasPi 3 A+. It will have the same function as the Pi Zero, but with the ability to run the VeinCam software faster and more efficiently due to its Quad-Core CPU (instead of the single-core in the Pi Zero). Preliminary pricing for these two models [has been determied](/Hardware/Estimated%20Financials.xlsx) and once these hardware requirements have been finalised, exploration of procerement options will commence.   

With this in mind, we hope to create a universal hardware platform for the VeinCam Software to utilise, while making the RasPi swappable. This means the VeinCam and its hardware will be able to run without issue regardless of the type of RasPi it is plugged into.

### Software
**SOFTWARE TEAM TO FILL OUT**

### Previous Updates
Previous project updates can be found in the [Project Updates](Administration/project-updates) directory, and will be populated as progress updates are made. Team work diaries can be found in the [Hardware](/Hardware/HardwareDiary.md) and [Software](/Software/SoftwareDiary.md) folders, as well as team [Decision Logs](/Administration/Project/Decision-Log.md) are other locations for progress notes, should they not be located on this page.

# 4. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations is still underdevelopment, but hope to be signed off by the team and our stakeholders soon.

The [Concept of Operations](Administration/Project/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

## Meeting Minutes
The team regularly meet to formally discuss the project's progress, as well as through other communication channels. the minutes from the formal discussions can be found in the [Meeting Minutes](Administration/meeting-minutes/) directory.
