* Took time to understand the previous code at a high level with help from previous team members
    * Resulted in the creation of a Visio diagram to visualize the overall system and what files were being used in what order.
    * Used the existing functioning RPi Zero to understand the limitations it currently has and how it performed under different conditions
* Ensured screen capture capabilities were working for virtual meetings for later code visualisation

    * Further image processing to better identify the veins
    * Optimisation of boot time and better indication to user of the boot progress
    * Improving front-end web page including more options, functionality, usability and information
    * General code cleaning and optimisation
* Static image processing testing was set up for quick idea verification using MATLAB given its inbuilt image processing capabilities
