This document is intended for the use of the Primary Client Ben Healy, for future project teams who are continuing with this project in future semesters. This document summarizes the development and progress of the project summarised as of November 2018.

## 1. Aims and purpose of this project
This project was started by the client who wished to develop an accessible and low-cost device that could be developed for the public for the purpose of enhanced vein visualisation using infra-red light - the VeinCam.

The client was delivered a preliminary prototype of the VeinCam at the end of the second semester in 2018
A full list of the project goals and stretch goals are in the [Concept of Operations document (ConOps)](/docs/CONOPS.md).

The project team is a group of four undergraduate ANU Engineering Students who completed a course which involved development of something as per the requirements and directions of the client. The course began in July 2018 and completed in November 2018.
A full list of the relevant stakeholders and their responsibilities at this stage of the project are
