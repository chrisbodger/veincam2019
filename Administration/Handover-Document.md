# Handover Document

This document is intended for the use of the Primary Client Ben Healy, for future project teams who are continuing with this project in future semesters. This document summarizes the development and progress of the project summarised as of November 2018.

## 1. Aims and purpose of this project
This project was started by the client who wished to develop an accessible and low-cost device that could be developed for the public for the purpose of enhanced vein visualisation using infra-red light - the VeinCam.

The client was delivered a preliminary prototype of the VeinCam at the end of the second semester in 2018
A full list of the project goals and stretch goals are in the [Concept of Operations document (ConOps)](/docs/CONOPS.md).

The project team is a group of four undergraduate ANU Engineering Students who completed a course which involved development of something as per the requirements and directions of the client. The course began in July 2018 and completed in November 2018.
A full list of the relevant stakeholders and their responsibilities at this stage of the project are
in the[ConOps](/docs/CONOPS.md).

The requirements developed by the project team and agreed upon by the client are listed in detail in the [Requirements](/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md)

## 2. Key development milestones and decisions

**Potential Improvements**



### 2.2. Hardware Development
**Low cost, easy to assemble enclosure**   
Last semester, the previous team had a 3d printed enclosure that was perfect for a prototype, however would not be appropiate for mass manufacturing. As the goal for this semester was to get the product ready for commercialisation, the enclosure was redesigned to allow for production in quantity at a low unit cost, along with being cheap and easy to ship and assemble. This resulted in a laser cut acrylic case which is held together with screws, which is both cheap and easy to manufacture and ship, but can also be assembled easily with a phillips head screwdriver.   

**Design of a highly integrated printed cicruit board**  
Moving to production hardware required a printed circuit board to hold the IR array, status LEDs, and the NoIR camera. This board played a key role in both the electrical and mechanical design, as on the electrical side it enabled a low cost and easily manufacturable way to connect all of the electronic components, whilst also allowing for the NoIR camera to be mounted in a low profile manner. 

**Potential Improvements**  
There is still room for improvement in the mechanical design, as whilst the method of holding the IR lens in place is functional, it is not exactly elegant.   
Currently the VeinCam also requires an external battery pack, which adds extra volume and makes it harder to hold onto. Whilst a version of the VeinCam with an integrated battery was partially designed, it was abandoned due to the added complexity of a fully integrated solution. An area for improvement may be taking a middle ground through figuring out a way to mount an external battery pack to the VeinCam, which will make it into one unit whilst not having the complexity and cost of a fully integrated solution.
