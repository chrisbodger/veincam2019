Today, Alex met with Stephanie Pratt, a member of the first VeinCam team that ran through Semester 2, 2019. Stephanie reviewed our hardware, major documentation, repository and landing page.

- Ensure that in Audit 3 presentation, the value of this semesters work is highlighted. Make clear of what's changed since the previous project.
- Compare current progress to Audit 1 goals in Audit 3 presentation. (Outline: What goals have we accomplished? What did we not accomplish?)
- Tabulate System Requirements into sections, so that all Requirements can be tested and validated. Without validation, there is no way to state that the system has met the outlined requirements. 
- Update the Decision Log!
- Contact Client and discuss how "educational" we wish to develop the device. e.g. Do we leave code out in sections for students to fill in? Do we need to create teaching manuals and educational resources in addition to the instruction manual? Provide Ben with these ideas for future development and update Handover Document. 

**Actionables**
- Updated System Requirements document.
- Updated Decision Log.
- Updated Handover Document
