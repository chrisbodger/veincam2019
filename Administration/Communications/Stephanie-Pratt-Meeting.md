Today, Alex met with Stephanie Pratt, a member of the first VeinCam team that ran through Semester 2, 2019. Stephanie reviewed our hardware, major documentation, repository and landing page.

- Ensure that in Audit 3, the value of this semesters work is highlighted. Make clear of what's changed since the previous project.
- Compare current progress to Audit 1 goals. (Outline: What goals have we accomplished? What did we not accomplish?)
-  

Compare to Audit 1 goals - what did we accomplish; Where we started in VeinCam 1 to now



Improve requirements 
Req, metric, test, importance (based on goals/client) - table
Durability requirement, how long will it last; especially if it's constantly pulled apart
E.g cost < $500 (estimated school budget @sarah)
Decision Log - align with requirements in order to pass/fail tests
Good with these requirements, not good with these ones. Here's what needs to be worked on in future.
cop out for commercialization document

DECISION LOG AND BONYTHON VISIT - Explore older software processes to improve image quality. Bonython image quality was garbage.

DECISION LOG - Educational info, what is your blood made up of. What is actually going through your veins

WELL COMMENTED CODE FOR STUDENTS

DECISION LOG (next steps/handover) - Multiple images for education, different image processes showing image processing (lower frame rate), different coding requirements, leave code empty!

Not just instructions will be required - teaching manuals, educational instructions and resources, etc

TALK TO BEN - what would he think? Purely educational for teachers vs more open source device and teachers can take it upon themselves

Software Diary - discovered that linear artifacts were due to the duty cycle being out-of-sync with the capture rate of the camera. Resolved by changing PWM duty cycle of the IR LEDs
