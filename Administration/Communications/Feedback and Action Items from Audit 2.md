# Feedback from Audit 2:

### Overall Feedback

Very positive. Our output, teamwork, internal and external communication and repository were all highly commended. The changes made from the feedback given in Audit 1 is visible and the impact on our project is clear. Definition in the Decision Log, further outlining how we communicate internally and with the client, and more making efforts to reach out to potential investors and parties which could provide useful feedback were the main themes of things to improve upon. 

### Audit Presentation
* Presentation of Hardware/Software was better suited for a general audience. 

### Governance
* Get governance and hardware members involved in software development to speed up process.
   - Probably don't need to given current software progress. Alex may get involved in tidying up front end and landing page webside==te

* Add justification, method comparison and risk analysis for each major decision made based on the ConOps risk analysis matrix. 

* Communicate how decisions make by hardware and software teams

* Decision log to be improved.
  * The decision log needs to be added to, with minor decisions also being noted.
  * Note the decision to code in Python instead of C++ and other minor decisions.
  * More regular recording of decisions being made by hardware and software subteams. 
  * Improved format of decision log for better readability and so that it accounts for future decisions being overturned and such changes occuring.
    * This can be achieved perhaps by use headings like Decision/Why/Evidence to support. Colour code, split into three categories. Maybe number decisions to better track.
    * Risk Analysis heading with severity and likelyhood rankings on each and the risk in making each decision.
    
### Hardware
* Feedback suggestion was to design full enclosure. This was initially considered and discussed at the beginnning of the project, but did not align with the kit concept and manufacturing/open source feasibility. Given recent dicussions regarding temperature regulation, the possibility of a full enclosure design has not been ruled out.
*


### Software
* Decision log is empty for software (aforementioned).


## Actions Completed
* Decision log can now be accessed from the conops.
* An introduction for the Veincam on the repo landing page has been added.

## Action Items from Audit 2 Feedback
* Update Decision Log to align with Hardware enclosure decisions. 
* Break down requirements for high level milestones.
* Until software is completed it is uncertain whether or not we will need two versions of the Veincam.
* Clarify commercialization verification meaning.
* Software and Hardware to better discuss technical decisions with whole team.
