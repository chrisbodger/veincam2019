Following our Poster Presentation, we recieved a message through our feedback form from an audience member who wishes to aid with the project in future!

**Have you got any feedback regarding the progress of the project so far?:**
Very proud, though would recommend making the camera stronger as it would be useful in hospitals, on site at accidents (e.g. car) to look for any internal bleeding for example.

**Have you got any feedback or advice regarding the software and hardware development?**
Increasing the power of the rays, modifying the infra-red camera to more of an x-ray or even black-light to get through the layers of fat and really define the veins - designing the camera lens to have multiple layers upon one another. It is really hard to describe this so please contact me and I can explain further: cjvlat58@gmail.com

**Have you got any feedback regarding our communication, both internally within the project team or externally to our stakeholders?**
Great, loved the presentation, was engaging and fun. Couldn't fault it.

**Have you any additional feedback or comments for the project team?**
I have had several years of experience within robotics and though I may not be studying engineering or be enrolled at ANU, I would love to be able to look at the veincam and it's blueprints and maybe lend a hand towards it's improvement.
