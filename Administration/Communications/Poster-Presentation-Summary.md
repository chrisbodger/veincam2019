The Poster Presentation was held on the 20/5/19 in the Hannah Neumann building at ANU. VeinCam saw a strong number of people interested and participate in the presentation.
All members were present at various times during the presentation. Our stall had a VeinCam running to demonstrate on people's arms, a website on another touch-screen laptop for virtual representation and of course, our poster, which drew in the crowd and several people commented on its design and professionalism.
In particular, one university colleague of Alex stated that someone had come up to them and said they were "very impressed" with what the VeinCam team had achieved.


Matt from Questacon, a client for another Capstone project group, gave suggestions as to how VeinCam could potentially be upscaled to be made into an exhibit at the Q-Lab:
- A large high resolution camera with a large screen. The camera faces down, and patrons place their arm underneath.
- Signage could encourage blood flow in the way of exersice, such as 10 jumping jacks, to then see how that affects bloodflow in the arms.
- VeinCam kit could then be sold in the gift shop!
- A potential Capstone project for the following semester.

Other patrons pointed out to us that being a cheap, infrared camera, that it could be further developed to have several other uses:
- Night sight camera/cheap doorbell security option.
- Temperature/heat signatures at a low level (much cheaper than ones on the market currently).
- Assisting in household chores where detecting hot spots would be useful. 

Overall, the VeinCam team's presentation was a success and provided an engaging, interactive experience for its audience.
