# Feedback from Audit 3

## Governance
* Good efforts to seek user testing and feedback. Connecting with primary schools and other external parties is excellent.
* Complete all documentation for handover.
* Decision making processes are well documented in decision log and relevant sections of the repository, however not all changes or decisions are taceable in the repository; it can be assumed that a great number of modification have taken place throughout the duration of course. The decision log may therefore be lacking.
* Improvement in decision making can be seen since Audit 2.
* Query regarding the number of responses we have had from the feedback form. Suggestion to change the feedback questions to that they are more quantitative (eg. rating out of 10).
* The team has evidently made great effort to imrpove the traceability of decisions. From and external view it is unclear how much imapct the client has had on the project. Suggestion to better document discussion with client. Limited communication and interaction with the client can be seen. Suggestion to add high level documentation detailing stakeholder interactions; Bonython Primary, describing the teams experience with dealing with said organisation/party, as well as the participants experience. Decisions tend to be only documentated at a high level. Some decisions noted in meeting minutes are not in the decision log; this inconsistency is an issue.
* Include commercial viability documentation as to assist future teams to understand the justification of design decisions.
* The hardware and software diaries improved throughout the course of the project, however still lack traceability and clarity.
* Assembly intructions are missing simple software details, such as the process of connecting to a wifi network. Such things, while simple for us, may not be for users and should therefore be clarified and fleshed out in detail.
* Harware assembly instructions can be improved with the inclusion of images.
* Remember that we are pitching to educators and teachers, not and engineering audience. Communication must be adapted for a less technical audience.
* The poster is very dark and images are small.

## Hardware
* *Only as aforementioned.*

## Software
* Very well done by the software team to deliver some last-minute requests for the client.
* Ensure commenting on code for handover to Client and future teams.

## Actionables
* Complete all documentation for handover.
* Commenting on code.
* Maintain/increase interest from external parties; primary and high schools, colleges and potentially Questacon.
* Improve decision log traceability.
* Improve hardware and software diary traceability.
* Improve assembly instructions; simplify to greater detail and include images.
* Potential improvement of feedback form.
