## Meeting Agenda
1. Client Meeting
2. Finalisation of project

## Governance
* Poster showcase went well. Good feedback from tutor.
* Handover document in the process of being finalised.
* Matt from Questacon has proposed Veincam as an exhibit; upscaling Veincam. This could be a potential project in the future.
* Ben believes that nursing/medical students will be a good market for Veincam. Potentially vet students. The issue with implementing Veincam in school curriculum can be expected to take a long time.

## Hardware
* To complete handover of all hardware to Ben.
* Smudging of acrylic is known to affect the image clarity, however alternatively opting for glass will bump up the price of the kit significantly. Potentially worth investigating this to see how significant the affect of smudging on image quality is. Acrylic is know to be doing its job, however image quality is potentially  affected. As noted at the project showcase, resolution is know to not be tied to image quality.

## Software
* Final documentation recently submitted on the repository.
* Scrolling issue solved, with implementing footer as a percentage. This is only an issue with high resolution screens.
* Decided to implement old image processing method to see the effect on image quality. This proved to yield slightly better image quality (in conjunction with the notably lower frame rate).

## Actionables
* Get photos for assembly.
* Finalise handover of all hardware to Ben.
* Finalise handover documentation.
* Money spent on project to be reimbursed by ANU, or resolved with Ben is necessary.
