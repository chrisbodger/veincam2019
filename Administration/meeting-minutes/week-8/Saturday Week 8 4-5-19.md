## Agenda
1. Ben's feedback
2. Project discussion

## Governance
* Ben has noted that we have potentially looked into the wrong market with kids at primary school. This was a misunderstanding however; this was opted for as it was provided by the ANU. The goal was to gain the connection in Sarah Fletcher from the Science industry. This connection with the school science director, who has great influence upon the science curriculum is very signficant to the progress of Veincam. Sarah has noted it not so much the technical side of things, but about the teaching of failure to kids and having a more open and adaptable educational tool.
* If Ben has no interest in providing the Veincam for educational purposes, it is uncertain that medical schools will opt for such technology as the Veincam doesnt do a good enough job for such applications. However, this is not our problem to consider, and is Ben's.

## Software
* Ben is happy with the current image quality; we are not to continue to improve this with the prospect for marginal improvement with a lot of effort.
* To implement a switch option between old and new method of image capture to then compare image processing and quality.
* Potential to implement a pause button; we'd be able to go from 20fps to a still image; actually pause the stream. This will enable the user to look at said captured image. Hence pause will display as still capture until resume is selected to prompt streaming.
* Attempt to remove linear artefacts.
* Ben does not necessarily care about the front end and associated improvement in these area.

## Hardware
* Ben is generally happy with the progress and status of hardware currently.
* Concern of camera out of the box's focus is terrible. If we can integrate a tool into the casing, then the fitting will be better. If its not screwed out a little bit you will still need plyers. If we need to use other tools to grab the camera, this may be annoying by worhtwhile to not damage the camera.
* SD cut out vs no SD car cutout; will aim to leave as is as it is able to be taken out if necessary but not so easy that kids/users can easily pull out the SD when the Veincam is running.
* Acryilic is to be shrunk to the diameter of the outer cell, and there will be a spacing between the camera and acryllic.

## Actionables
* Aims to finalise all aspects of the project for handover.

### Hardware
* To finalise laser cutt-outs for pricing.

### Software
* Make sure switching between old and new methods work.
* Clean up main script and do some commenting where required.
* Write a document on how functions work for future teams.
* Rest of efforts to be given towards removal of linear artefacts.

### Governance
* Gain contact with Gunghalin College.
* Finalise poster.
* Clean up repository.
* Get everything ready for handover.
