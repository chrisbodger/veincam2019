## Agenda
1. Project Discussion

## Project Discussion
### Governance
* Software and Hardware diaries are up. Aim to continue to update consistently and thoroughly throughout the duration of the project.
* Commercialization parameters should be investigated to verify associated commercial feasibility of the system.

### Hardware
* Discussion of procurement of boards/quantity. Currently estimated to be 560 AUD for 1000 quantity. Very good to be <100AUD for whole system.
* Can use the CNC machine in the Makerspace  to manufacture the enclosure, then use CAD to design  the enclosure. This will involve a couple days of printing, cutting out and building the enclosure.
* Have made it possible for all types of batteries to work.
* LEDs are not widely and readily available and there is an approximate month scale waiting time. Alternative LEDs are however not of sufficient intensity. Core Electronics, a retailer for electronics in Australia Raspberry Pia as well as other potential retailers may be  a good contact to discuss high-quantity purchases and educational use, as well as shipping and support.
* Resolution of Raspberry Pi camera is close to 4K. Do we wish to try and find a better camera as to optimise aperture and clarity. This may be something worthwhile investigating, however the Pi camera appears to be satisfactory. It should be noted that a different camera must not have an IR filter over the lense. An alternative camera, the OpenMV Cam H7; is an open-source MicroPython powered machine vision camera designed for low-power real-time applications, similar to a super powerful Arduino with a camera on board that you program in Python, has been investigated and found to be inappropriate for the wireless connection desired and as such unsuitable for the project's application.

### Software
* Computational saving with regards to OpenCV loading.
* Visio diagram has been completed.
* The goal of comprehension/understanding of the code has been achieved.
* Development mode currently working; originally was only working for a Microsoft system.

### Technical Leadership Program
* Josh and Chris attended on the 18/03/19. Salient points include:
  * Maintaining a clear value proposition.
  * Group collaboration; to be done when Audits begin.
  * Evenly distributing work amongst group members.
  * Team performance and weaknesses. Currently we struggle to change things due to the amount of code being overwhelming. Aim to reduce/simplify the number of files being used.

## Deliverables
### Governance
* Maintain Software and Hardware diaries.
* Commercialization parameters to be produced as to verify associated commercial feasibility of system.

### Hardware
* Hardware to potentially be sorted by the mid-semester break.
* Goal of filling out orders this week; have boards and parts next week (Week 5). Week 6/7 bring it all together. By the break have a working board.
* Aim to have CAD files and everything necessary done so it all can be given to the client, and he can then proceed with manufacture as desired.

### Software
* Find a way to computationally save with regards to OpenCV.
* Reduce number of files used. Simplify and re-write code where possible or necessary.

## Decisions made
* Nil.

## Goals for next week
* Gain feedback from Audit 1. Develop actionables from feedback.

## Actionables
* Look into getting temporary group tattoos.
* Tom to continue with maintenance of requirements, decision log and meeting minutes. Assist Patrick with html if possible. Assist Alex O with developing commercialization parameters for system.
* Patrick to clone SD card as Ben wants it back. Continue optimising code.
* Josh to fill out orders for hardware.
* Alex B to continue optimising code.
* Alex O to develop commercialization parameters for system.
* Chris procurement and research.
