### Feedback from Audit 1:
## Audit Presentation
* Presentation of Hardware/Software was too technical and esoteric.

## Governance
* Continue to keep documentation up to date and at a high quality.

* Repository has minor technical issues
  * Decision log can be accessed from repository but not from Conops.
  * An introduction to Veincam on the landing page is lacking. This will help uninvolved individuals to better familiarise themselves with the project.

* Requirements are currently too high level and should aim to be broken down beyond merely Goverance, Software and Hardware categorisation.

* Define weekly goals and/or deliverables, as current goals are quite broad. While goals/deliverable/actionables presented in meeting minutes are evidently related to the overall project requirements, these should be broken down as much as possible.

* Greater detail in the WBS and milestones is needed. This may include the addiation of a timelines, noting the division of tasks and the like.

* Proposal for use of Gantt charts to aid in tracking of project.

* Weekly outcomes should be clearly documented.

* There is a lack of clarity regarding the difference between both proposed versions of Veincam.
  * Clarification is needed regarding the difference in requirements between the Zero and Plus models.
  * More dialogue with Ben may be required.
  
* Validation of products' commercial potential and how commercialization may occur should be achieved.
  * Gauge the interest from other clients and parties to determine further product deliverables beyond what Ben wants.
  * Connect with educational/medical parties to gauge interest and get input.
  * Define metrics for commercialization.
  
* Deal with ethics approval to prompt testing.

* Formal reviews of decisions made by sub-teams should be undertaken so that the whole team understands and agrees with said decisions and the progress of team divisions. Better discourse and debriefing regarding decisions must be achieved.

* Decision log to be improved.
  * The decision log needs to be added to, with minor decisions also being noted.
  * Decision log is empty for software – potential communication issue, however software sub-team has only recently achieved comprehension goal of code, as such not many decisions have been made.
    * Note the decision to code in Python instead of C++ and other minor decisions. More regular recording of decisions.
  * Improved format of decision log for better readability and so that it accounts for future decisions being overturned and such changes occuring.
    * This can be achieved perhaps by use headings like Decision/Why/Evidence to support. Colour code, split into three categories. Maybe number decisions to better track.
  * Better justification of decisions such as input from stakeholders, advisory boards or reference groups.
  * Note accountability/responsibility for decisions in decision log and note when/if decisions are revisited.

* Include absence of Ben in meeting minutes or have separate folders for client and team meetings.

## Hardware
* More discussion as a team prior to CAD drawings; greater discourse prior to major action.
* Better communication with client as to not waste hours of work due to redundance.

## Software
* Decision log is empty for software – potential communication issue, however software sub-team has only recently achieved comprehension goal of code, as such not many decisions have been made.
  * Note the decision to code in Python instead of C++ and other minor decisions. More regular recording of decisions.
