Looking at licensing for the VeinCam Project, a few key things were taken into account:
* Ensuring that the code and hardware is kept open source and free forever. 
* Ensure any future development by others is kept open and not rolled into a closed source product. 
* Ensuring that we do not violate any licenses of software that has been included in the VeinCam. 

 All of code included in the software is either licensed under the MIT or BSD licenses, which are permissive free licenses, and have be described as "allows people to do anything they want with your code as long as they provide attribution back to you and donâ€™t hold you liable." ([Github choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/)). 
 This means that as long as we include attribution to these projects through keeping the included 'licence' or 'copying' files which were included in the package, they can not only be used, but can also be included in a licence which has tigher restricitons on what someone can do with them.  

 The licence which we have chosen for the VeinCam is the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3). It is a licence which allows people to do almost anything, _except_ to distribute closed source versions of the hardware and software. This ensures that any changes people make to the project have to be put back into the public domain, allowing everyone to benifit from improvements to the code or hardware.
