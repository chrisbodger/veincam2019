### System Requirements:
1. Compared to other devices with similar functionality, the produced device must be relatively inexpensive.
2. The device must be simple to construct, easily reproduced (and/or easily manufacturable?)
3. The device must be simple to use. Ease of use should be correlated with the intended educational application of the device, and as such be relevant for expected users.
4. The device must be able to use near infrared (NIR) illumination and real-time image processing to make veins appear most visible in an efficient manner. This criterion must be of a level of quality that is satisfactory for educational use.
5. The device must run primarily off of battery power.
6. The device must be able to wirelessly connect to an external device with a screen.
7. The device must be portable and mobile.
8. The device must be reasonably easy to maintain, clean and fix in the event of failure/break/degradation.
9. The device should display veins in as many use-cases as possible (e.g. dark-skinned, tattooed, hairy). (Stretch deliverable)
10. The device is manufacturable to be delivered to a commercial market. (Stretch deliverable)

### Requirements of Hardware Team
1. Redesign device enclosure(s) to accomodate Raspberry Pi A+ and Raspberry Pi Zero.
2. Research materials and compare between manufacturing cases vs using off the shelf components.
3. 

### Requirements of Software Team
1. Modify current image processing code to be more efficient.
2. Improve start up time.
3. Clean up front end user interface.
4. Research most optimal programming language for image processing (C++ vs Python)
5. Introduce photo image processing on top of the equalised image to detect veins within relative bounds.
