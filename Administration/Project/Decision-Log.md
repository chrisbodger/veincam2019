| Whole system      |Look into **two versions of system with different levels of sophistication and functionality**. This will aim to cater to users that are merely interested in the system for entertainment purposes and those who wish to apply the device for advanced educational use. This will involve selection use of the Raspberry Zero and Raspberry A+ platform.  | 12/03/19 | 3 |
|Software|Decision to code in Python instead of C++. This is due to knowing that everything works in Python and not wanting to rewrite everything in C++.|12/03/2019|3|
|Hardware| Option of adding a **built-in battery has been dissolved**. Adding a built-in battery will increase build cost, board complexity, as such impacting on automated assembly, risk of failure and product return. Ben has noted that there is not substantial enough saleable benefit to be gained as to justify said cost and risk of a built-in battery.|19/03/19|4|
|Hardware|Boards for the Zero and Plus versions will be produced in red and blue, respectively. The viencam.org url and version number to be added to the boards.|23/03/19|4|
|Governance|Following Audit 1 feedback, discussed with primary client the relevance of requiring ANU Ethics approval. Given the goal of this project is to design a commercial kit, not commercialise a product, go to market, or test it publically, the decision has been made to not seek ANU Ethics approval. |24/03/2019|5|
|Whole system|Until software is verified the need and/or potential for two verions of the system is uncertain. Therefore it is decided for software to be verified prior to final decision whether or not to deliver several versions.|26/03/19|5|
