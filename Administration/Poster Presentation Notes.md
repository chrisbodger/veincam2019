# Poster Presentation Notes

* How do we make the poster stand out? There will be ~105 posters on the day (due to the additon of 4200 presentations).

## Don't
* Excessive text.
* Bad colour contrast. Note that something that looks good on the computer may not be so when printed out. Try to not use photo backgrounds. Note how it will look when printed out vs. on the computer screen.

## Do
* Reduce amount of text. Should provide a broad overview not over-detailed information. Catching the viewers attention is difficult when there is excessive text.
* Have a good image capture point. The first few seconds will determine whether or not the viewer is interested or not. There must be on hook aka hero image. These will present the key elements of the project to the viewer. This can be exemplfied by movie posters which convey the key elements of a movie to the viewer (at the most simple level), in aim to get them interested. This will present the main objective of the project and main output of the project.
* Customise colours so that everything is consistent; don't merely copy images from external sources or the like.

## Specifications
* A1 size, however design for A0.
* No template to follow.
* Submit as PDF on wattle.
* Include names of all team members.
* Logos or recognition from the client (including their name(s)). Represent client and all stakeholders on poster.
* Note that this is not an academic. It is a design poster; therefore be creative with visualisation.

## Recommendations
* Consider poster as a conversation starter and engagement piece. Always keep to poster manned to facilitate discussion.
* Use readable font such as sans-serif fonts, e.g. Helvetica or Roboto.
* Add a QR code or some link to the repository.
* Can include props/prototypes for table at poster presentation.
* Prioritise initial hook/spark of interest as viewers will not spend more than a few minutes on a single poster.
