# Poster Presentation Notes

* How do we make the poster stand out? There will be ~105 posters on the day (due to the additon of 4200 presentations).

## Don't
* Excessive text.
* Bad colour contrast. Note that something that looks good on the computer may not be so when printed out. Try to not use photo backgrounds. Note how it will look when printed out vs. on the computer screen.

## Do
* Reduce amount of text. Should provide a broad overview not over-detailed information. Catching the viewers attention is difficult when there is excessive text.
* Have a good image capture point. The first few seconds will determine whether or not the viewer is interested or not. There must be on hook aka hero image. These will present the key elements of the project to the viewer. This can be exemplfied by movie posters which convey the key elements of a movie to the viewer (at the most simple level), in aim to get them interested. This will present the main objective of the project and main output of the project.
* Customise colours so that everything is consistent; don't merely copy images from external sources or the like.

## Specifications
* A1 size, however design for A0. Should be printable for all sizes.
* No template to follow.
* Submit as PDF on wattle.
* Include names of all team members.
* Logos or recognition from the client (including their name(s)). Represent client and all stakeholders on poster.
* Note that this is not an academic. It is a design poster; therefore be creative with visualisation.

## Recommendations
* Less is more. Do something that is attractive to try and promote interest.
* Consider poster as a conversation starter and engagement piece. Always keep to poster manned to facilitate discussion.
* Use readable font such as sans-serif fonts, e.g. Helvetica or Roboto.
* Add a QR code or some link to the repository. The audience should be able to get in contact with team/clients and there should be the potential for future opportunities.
* Can include props/prototypes for table at poster presentation.
* Prioritise initial hook/spark of interest as viewers will not spend more than a few minutes on a single poster.
* Vector based graphics are ideal.
* Consider that things look different on the screen than when printed out.
* Having 6-8 team members in front of the poster at one time can be intimidating to viewers, and may negatively affect conversations. Therefore, you may wish to only have 2-3 team members at the poster at a given time as to better facilitate discussion.
* If presenting data don't use a table; use charts or some visual display.

## Actionables
* Get draft ready for Monday Week 10 Tute for feedback prior to submission on Wednesday.
